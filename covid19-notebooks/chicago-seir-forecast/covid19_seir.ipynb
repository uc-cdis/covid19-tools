    "# COVID-19 forecasting using SEIR models\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical modelling is an important component of epidemiology and infection disease research. In particular, compartmental models have been used since the early 20th century. Here, a population is divided into compartments and it is assumed that individuals in the same compartment have the same characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SIR model is a well-known and relatively simplistic compartmental model consisting of three compartments: susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered/deceased/immune (R; sometimes referred to as “removed” in this notebook). The SIR model has many derivations that build upon it. Our focus, the SEIR model, includes an additional compartment for people who are exposed (E) and is often used for infections with a significant incubation period where individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variables (S, E, I, and R) represent how many (or the proportion of) people are in each compartment at a particular time. Since the SEIR model is dynamic, the numbers in each compartment may fluctuate over time and there are relationships between each of the states. For example, the number of susceptible (S) individuals falls as more individuals are exposed/infected, and the disease likely cannot break out again until a large portion of the population return to being susceptible (S). The SEIR model includes parameters which determine the rate at which individuals move from being susceptible to exposed (beta), from exposed to infected (epsilon), and from infected to recovered (gamma). Finally, SEIR models may include parameters for background mortality and birth rates, but often make the assumption that they are equal. It is important to note that any given SEIR model is based on a particular population and it may not be appropriate to use on other populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we construct an SEIR model for COVID-19 in Cook County, Illinois, using data sourced from Johns Hopkins University, but available within the Chicagoland COVID-19 Commons. We then perform an optimization of initial model parameter values and do some simple validation. This notebook is intended to demonstrate real-life usage of data for epidemiological modeling and is not intended for rigorous scientific interpretation."

    "Here we’ve plotted the relative frequency of each compartment over time. Starting at day 1 we can see that essentially the entire population is susceptible and a very small portion are exposed, infectious, or removed. Tracing the curves to the right we see a sharp drop in the susceptible curve with corresponding peaks in the exposed and infectious curves and sharp rise in the removed curve. As we move beyond the peak of the infectious curve we find that the compartments quickly stabilize to their long-run values. The outbreak comes to a close as the exposed and infectious curves approach zero. We observe that by the end of the outbreak the vast majority of the population will have become infected and subsequently passed through to the removed compartment (the removed curve stabilizes close to 1). In turn, in this simulation only a small portion of the population avoided infection (the susceptible curve stabilizes close to 0)."

    "\n",
    "Due to lack of widespread testing it’s understood that there are many cases which do not get detected and therefore are not reflected in the reported case counts data. In particular, mild and asymptomatic cases are not being detected. While it is currently unknown what percentage of infections end up as mild or asymptomatic, that figure has been estimated (see papers referenced in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00822-x)) to be as high as 40-50%. This means that any dataset can only at best offer a highly incomplete picture of the whole situation. In spite of this fact, validating simulation results from the model against real data is the only way to determine whether or not the model faithfully represents the actual outbreak. \n",

    "Although we cannot truly validate the model using an incomplete dataset, it is still valuable to compare simulation results against real data. Using confirmed case counts data for Cook County from the JHU COVID-19 dataset, we compare the simulated infection rate against the observed infection rate. It is important to note that true parameter values for the model vary by population - that is, parameter values used to model the Wuhan outbreak need not be the same as the parameter values used to model the New York City outbreak. Note that in this initial simulation we used parameter values which were not estimated from the Cook County population - accordingly, we expect to see deviations between the observed data and simulation results.\n",
