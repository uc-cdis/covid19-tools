    "Google community mobility data is the open-source data reflecting the mobility changes across global communities in response to policies aimed at combating the COVID-19 crisis. This data set tracks daily movement trends into six categories, including retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacy, parks, transit stations, workplace, and residential. In this notebook, we demonstrate how to query google mobility data using the BigQuery API client python library, and visualize the mobility changes over time since February 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Google mobility data\n",
    "- Google documentation on mobility data is [here](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/data_documentation.html).\n",
    "- Mobility report does not give an absolute visitor number, but relative changes instead. These values were calculated by comparing to a baseline derived from dates before the pandemic started.\n",
    "- The baseline is the median value, for the corresponding day of the week, during the 5-week period Jan 3â€“Feb 6, 2020.  We advise users to interpret the Google mobility trend cautiously since the baseline mobility patterns are impacted by other region-specific factors, such as weather and local events.\n",
    "- There are gaps and missing data for dates that do not meet the privacy threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Notebook\n",
    "Using the Google BigQuery API Client library requires **authentication** set up. Please follow the [Instruction](\n",
    "https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries#setting_up_authentication) and download the a JSON key to your local computer.\n",

    "- A significant increase in park visits was observed in Cook County between June and October, 2020\n",
    "- Mobility in \"`Transit`\" and \"`Workplace`\" has decreased around 50% since the pandemic started.\n",
    "- Large numbers of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 were observed between October 2020 and Jan 2020 in cook county, compared to the spring of 2020. However, the lower number of confirmed cases during the spring of 2020 is likely caused by limited testing capacity at the begining of the pandemic."
